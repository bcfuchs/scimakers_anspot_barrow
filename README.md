# Scimakers Barrow Hack -- Animal Spotting App

This is a quick prototype of an animal spotting app for the Barrow ScienceMakers project. 

The prototype uses apache cordova and is designed mainly with android in mind. 

The basic idea is: 

1. Take photo

2. Fill out form for id'ing photo subject. 

3. Upload photo 

4. Submit form with photo id and user id 

Our first go uses oauth with fb, but probably we'll change this when we have a reasonable server of our own...
